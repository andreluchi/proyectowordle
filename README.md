## Utility

This is a standalone project I made alone, not really looking for contributors but I'd be glad to listen to any suggestions apart from "this is missing from here".
If you have any doubts or info I'd be glad to answer them, also you can click the question mark symbol if you have any doubts on how to play.
This project was a big help in understanding react, css and js. Had a hard time with the functionality of the game itself which is why it's missing some features from the original.
